                agree, you must not use the App. You represent that you are at least thirteen (13) years old;
                individuals
                aged 13 to 17 may only use the App with the consent of a parent or legal guardian who accepts
                responsibility for the minor's use.</p>
            <h3>2. Definitions</h3>

            <h3>3. Licence Grant</h3>
            <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a personal, revocable, non-exclusive,
                non-transferable, and non-sublicensable licence to install and use the App solely for your personal
                entertainment. All rights not expressly granted are reserved. You must not copy, modify, distribute,

                extent such restrictions are prohibited by applicable law.</p>
            <h3>4. Accounts and Credentials</h3>
            <p>The App uses Google Sign-In for authentication. You are responsible for safeguarding your account
                credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must promptly notify us of any

                operating and improving the App. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to
                submit the

            <h3>6. Future Paid Features</h3>
            <p>The App is presently provided without charge. We may introduce in-app purchases or subscription-based

                policies
                before you complete any purchase. Purchases will be processed through your app store provider, and

                these Terms:</p>

            </ul>
            <h3>8. Acceptable Use</h3>
            <p>You agree not to:</p>
            <ul>

                revoke in-app items, or delete Content where we reasonably believe these Terms have been breached.
            </p>
            <h3>9. Availability and Updates</h3>
            <p>The App requires an active internet connection. Availability may be affected by network outages,
                device
                constraints, or third-party service interruptions. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any
                feature or the
                entire App at any time without liability, subject to applicable consumer-protection laws.</p>
            <h3>10. Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether
                express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness
                for a
                particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be
                uninterrupted or
                error-free.</p>
            <h3>11. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Puzzle Royale shall not be liable for any indirect,
                incidental,
                consequential, special, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or
                other
                intangible losses arising out of or in connection with your use of the App. Our aggregate liability
                for all
                claims arising out of or relating to the App shall not exceed the greater of (a) EUR 10 or (b) the
                total
                amounts you paid to us, if any, in the six (6) months preceding the event giving rise to the
                liability. These
                limitations do not exclude liability for intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or any matter for
                which
                liability cannot be excluded under applicable law.</p>
            <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Puzzle Royale from and against any claims, damages,
                losses,
                liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in connection with
                your breach
                of these Terms or your misuse of the App.</p>
            <h3>13. Termination</h3>
            <p>You may cease using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you materially
                breach
                these Terms, if we discontinue the App, or if required by law. Upon termination, the licence granted
                to you
                under Section 3 terminates immediately, and you must uninstall the App. Sections that by their
                nature should
                survive termination shall remain in force.</p>
            <h3>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands. Any dispute
                arising
                out of or relating to the App or these Terms shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
                competent courts in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Mandatory consumer-protection laws in your country
                of
                residence may grant you additional rights.</p>
            <h3>15. Notices</h3>
            <p>We may provide notices to you by email, in-app messages, postings within the App, or updates to our
                website.

                natural disasters, acts of government, labour disputes, internet or telecommunication failures, or
                acts of
                third parties.</p>
            <h3>17. Changes to the Terms</h3>
