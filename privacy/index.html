            <h3>3. Purposes and Legal Bases for Processing</h3>
            <p>Your personal data is processed for the following purposes and legal bases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contract performance (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> to create and maintain your
                    account,
                    deliver multiplayer functionality, synchronise progress, and provide core gameplay features.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong> to protect the Services against
                    fraud
                    and abuse (including cheat detection and enforcement), to analyse usage for service improvement,
                    and to maintain the stability and security of our infrastructure. Our interests are balanced
                    against your rights and freedoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> for optional features such as uploading a
                    profile
                    image or granting camera/photo-library permissions. You may withdraw consent at any time inside
                    the App or by contacting us.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>4. Recipients and Processors</h3>
            <p>We engage Google LLC and its affiliates (Firebase, Google Play Services, Google Analytics for
                Firebase,
                Firebase Crashlytics) as data processors pursuant to written data-processing agreements. Personal
                data
                may also be disclosed to competent authorities or legal counsel where disclosure is required to
                comply
                with legal obligations or to protect our legitimate interests (for example, in connection with
                enforcement of the Terms &amp; Conditions).</p>
            <h3>5. International Data Transfers</h3>
            <p>Personal data may be stored on or accessed from servers located outside the European Economic Area,
                including the United States. Such transfers rely on appropriate safeguards, including Standard
                Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission and, where applicable, supplementary
                protective measures implemented by Google LLC.</p>
            <h3>6. Retention Periods</h3>
            <p>We retain account data and gameplay history for as long as your account remains active. When you use
                the in-app deletion function, we will delete or anonymise personal data within thirty (30) days,
                unless
                longer retention is required for legal, regulatory, or dispute-resolution purposes. Aggregated or
                anonymised analytics data may be retained indefinitely.</p>
            <h3>7. Data Subject Rights</h3>
            <p>Subject to applicable law, you may request access to, rectification or erasure of, or restriction of
                processing concerning your personal data. You may also object to processing based on legitimate
                interests, request data portability, or lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.
                Please
                submit requests via the in-app tools or by emailing <a
                    href="mailto:mccarrenapps@gmail.com">mccarrenapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>
            <h3>8. Children</h3>
            <p>The Services are intended for individuals aged thirteen (13) years and older. We do not knowingly
                collect
                personal data from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has
                provided personal data without consent, contact us so that we can delete the information promptly.
            </p>
            <h3>9. Security Measures</h3>
            <p>We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the nature of the data,
                including Firebase Authentication, App Check, Play Integrity API, encrypted transport, and access
                controls. While we strive to protect personal data, no security measure is infallible. We will
                notify
                affected users and competent authorities of personal-data breaches when legally required.</p>
            <h3>10. Updates to this Policy</h3>
            <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in law, our processing
                activities, or the Services. Material changes will be communicated through the App, our website, or
                app
                store listings. Continued use of the Services after the effective date constitutes acknowledgement
                of
                the revised policy.</p>
