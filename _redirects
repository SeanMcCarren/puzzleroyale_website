# Cloudflare Pages Redirects

# Profile sharing deep links
# Serve the same static HTML for any /u/* path so the page's JS can handle the uid.
# Profile sharing deep links are managed in the Cloudflare Pages Redirects UI.
# Keeping this file without a `/u/*` rule avoids Pages' infinite-loop validator.

# (Do NOT add rules that map /privacy/* to /privacy/index.html — that causes infinite loops)
